I was catching up with a colleague recently who was lamenting the need to replace a senior member of her team, the challenge of getting the right person and the costs involved. As we talked about her challenges, it got me thinking, if recruiting new employees is so critical to business success, why do so many organizations struggle with it?

Finding the right person is about more than just skills and experience on a resume. It requires a deep understanding of:

1. **The Role:** Not just the job description, but the outcomes required for success.
2. **The Culture:** How the person will fit into the existing team dynamics.
3. **The Future:** Does this person have the potential to grow with the business?

At Harnessing Talent, we help organizations design recruitment frameworks that go beyond the basics, ensuring you have the right people in the right jobs at the right time.
